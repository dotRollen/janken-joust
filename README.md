# rock-paper-scissors

Very basic game using HTML and Javascript. Press r, p, or s to start playing!

Computer player gets an array with choices r, s, p. Computer will then get a random choice upon player beginning the game and release a key. The key stroke is stored in a variable and so is the computer's random guess. An if statement checks to see if the player used the correct keys. 

After the first if condition is met, the second if conditions will check what the player guessed and what the computer guessed. When a match is made, the player or computer will be rewarded a point!


TODO:

* Add a function that ends game after either player reaches a certain score for a game over and reset.
* Add a feature to allow user to enter name
* Add reset button
* Add CSS styling
